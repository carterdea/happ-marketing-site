			<h1>Terms of Service ("Terms")</h1>
			<p>Last updated: February 24, 2016</p>
			<p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Happ mobile application (the "Service") operated by Happ Corporation ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
			<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
			<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>
			<h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>
			<p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Happ Corporation.</p>
			<p>Happ Corporation has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that Happ Corporation shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third party web sites or services along with the use of Happ or services provided by us.</p>
			<p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third party web sites or services that you visit.</p>
			<h3>Who Can Use the Services</h3>
			<p>No one under age 16 is allowed to use Happ. We or our partners may offer additional Services with additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So please read all terms carefully. When using Happ, you state that you’re 16 years or older. If you’re under the age of 18, your parent and/or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms.</p>
			<h3>Your Content</h3>
			<p>When posting content on Happ, you grant Happ a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, publicly perform, broadcast, distribute, syndicate, promote, exhibit, and publicly display that content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). We will use this license for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services; researching and developing new ones; and making content submitted through the Services available to our business partners for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication outside the Services. Some Services offer you tools to control who can—and cannot—see your content under this license. For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our privacy policy</p>
			<h3>The Content of Others</h3>
			Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that created it. Although Happ reserves the right to review all content that appears on the platform and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.
			Through these terms we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines. Any content displaying illegal activity will be reported to the police and other law enforcement agencies.

			<h3>Termination</h3>
			<p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
			<p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
			<h3>Governing Law</h3>
			<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
			<p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>
			<h3>Changes</h3>
			<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
			<p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
			<h3>Indemnification</h3>
			<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Happ, our managing members, shareholders, employees, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms. If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a business or other entity, this indemnity obligation applies to that business or other entity.</p>
